# brewerysearchuidemo
This is a simple demo react app!
It consumes a REST endpoint which exposes OpenBreweryDB for search. Purely done for kata and demo puposes. It is hosted using github-pages as a static site.
The website can be accessed at [https://naveenhn.github.io/brewerysearchuidemo] (https://naveenhn.github.io/brewerysearchuidemo)
The API it consumes is hosted as a Heroku Java app and is accessible at [https://murmuring-basin-65291.herokuapp.com/breweries](https://murmuring-basin-65291.herokuapp.com/breweries). 

I may shutdown the Heroku app after a while! The code to this psuedo facade service can be found [here](https://github.com/naveenhn/brewerysearchdemo)

Cheers!
